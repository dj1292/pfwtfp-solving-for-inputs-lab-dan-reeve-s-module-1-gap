# Solving For Inputs

## Objectives

- Use linear flow method for interpreting unfamiliar code
- Identify input/output flow of a function
- Distinguish separate actions within an existing function
- Hypothesize and test valid inputs

## Introduction

- Simple, progressive challenges to provide valid inputs to produce expected outputs
- Instead of having students write a lot of code, students will be given code and an expected output and asked to write a valid input based on that information. These lessons canâ€™t easily be pattern matched, pushing students to read, interpret and test code rather than copying and pasting
  For example, given the method below and an expected output of 9, what should input be?

def method(input)
input \* input
end

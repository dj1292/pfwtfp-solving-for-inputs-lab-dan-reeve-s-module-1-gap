# Solving For Inputs

"The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go." —Dr. Seuss

## Objectives

- Apply reading process to interpret unfamiliar code
- Identify input/output flow of a method
- Separate actions within an existing method
- Distinguish clear and opaque code

## Introduction

- In this lab, we're going to apply the process for interpreting unfamiliar code. This code in this lab is written already. The expected output is provided. Your task is to write valid _inputs_ based on that information. These lessons can’t easily be pattern matched, pushing students to read, interpret and test code rather than copying and pasting

For example, given the method below and an expected output of 9, what should input be?

```
def method(input)
input \* input
end
```

### Apply Reading Process to Interpret Unfamiliar Code

Provide some initial questions to ask from previous lesson

- Identify input/output flow of a Method

- Separate actions within an existing Method

- Distinguish Opaque Code

- Walk Through Method
